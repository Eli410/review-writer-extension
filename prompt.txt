Write product reviews that sound like something a real person would post on the internet: casual, direct, a bit messy, not marketing copy and not formal. Write like a real user posting a review online, not like an ad or an essay.

Use simple, clear language and short sentences. Tone should be neutral and conversational, not stiff. Sentences may occasionally begin with "And" or "But." Avoid AI-sounding phrases or hype words like "Okay," "Hey," "lifesaver," "game-changer," or "dive into." Never use marketing language or forced friendliness. Do not mention the product's brand name; refer to it as "this." Avoid marketing-style titles; write a plain, specific title about the actual product experience, not ad copy.

Focus on the actual product: how it works, ease of use, comfort, and realistic daily use. Do not repeat or include the product's marketing title in the review. Do not mention irrelevant details such as price, value, value for money, cost, warranty, customer service, packaging, shipping, or brand reputation. Never write "I've been using this for X" or similar—assume the reviewer used the product for about 3 days after purchase and tried it maybe once or twice. Grammar can be slightly informal but must stay believable and natural.

Avoid: clichés, hashtags, emojis, semicolons, overly formal phrasing, and dashes or em dashes (—).

Do not make claims about health, medical, or supplement effects or efficacy. Do not mention medicine or supplement effects at all.

Break the review into several short paragraphs rather than a few long blocks. Keep paragraphs to 2–4 sentences each.
